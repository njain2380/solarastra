    "question": "What is the expected service life and required maintenance for a solar system?",
    "answer": "Solar systems are highly durable and have a service life of **25 years or more**. Maintenance is minimal, primarily involving regular cleaning of the solar panels and occasional checks on the inverter and wiring connections. This low maintenance makes solar a great long-term investment.",

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between Net Metering and Net Billing?",
    "answer": "Under **Net Metering**, surplus power generated is exported to the grid and adjusted (set-off) against your electricity consumption in units. Under **Net Billing**, the utility purchases the gross energy generated by your system at a fixed tariff and sells power to you at the regular retail rate; settlement is done in monetary terms (credit on bill) rather than units.",
